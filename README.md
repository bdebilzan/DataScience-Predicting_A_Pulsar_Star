Algorithms used in complete project included: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree. We determined which ML algorithms were effective and which were impractical.

My portion of the project contains:

-Importing appropriate libraries and packages from sklearn, numpy, and pandas.
-Reading of CSV file from Kaggle.
-Checking the dataset.

-Use of Random Forest.
-Changing of column names.
-Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
-Comparing the predicted labels for the testing set with it's actual labels to evaluate accuracy.
-Element to element comparison and printing portion of correct predictions.
-Cross val score.
-Printing of mean cross val score.

-Use of Linear Regression.
-Fitting model to training data.
-Predictions on the testing set.
-Evaluation for regression including Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
-Application of 10-fold cross validation with linear regression.
-Calculation of RMSE and calculation of the average RMSE as final result of cross validation.
