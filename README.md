Algorithms used in complete project included: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree. We determined which ML algorithms were effective and which were impractical.

My portion of the project contains:

-Importing appropriate libraries and packages from sklearn, numpy, and pandas.<br>
-Reading of CSV file from Kaggle.<br>
-Checking the dataset.<br>

-Use of Random Forest.<br>
-Changing of column names.<br>
-Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>
-Comparing the predicted labels for the testing set with it's actual labels to evaluate accuracy.<br>
-Element to element comparison and printing portion of correct predictions.<br>
-Cross val score.<br>
-Printing of mean cross val score.<br>

-Use of Linear Regression.<br>
-Fitting model to training data.<br>
-Predictions on the testing set.<br>
-Evaluation for regression including Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).<br>
-Application of 10-fold cross validation with linear regression.<br>
-Calculation of RMSE and calculation of the average RMSE as final result of cross validation.
